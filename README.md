Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was focused on developing an online system to help customers improve their chances of passing their DMV driving tests. The client, Liam, the owner of DriverPass, wanted a system that would offer online driver training courses, practice tests, and scheduling for on-the-road driving lessons. The system needed to allow customers to register, book and modify appointments, track their progress, and securely process payments. Additionally, the system had to support role-based access for different users, such as the owner, IT officer, secretary, and customers, while ensuring security and scalability through cloud-based storage.  

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did particularly well in outlining the system’s functional and nonfunctional requirements in a clear and structured manner. The breakdown of system components, user roles, and security considerations was thorough, ensuring that all key features and constraints were addressed. Additionally, I effectively considered user needs by detailing the functionality of the user interface and the accessibility requirements. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would refine the limitations section by conducting a deeper analysis of potential technical constraints, such as system scalability and handling high traffic loads. I would also improve the adaptability section by specifying how updates and changes to the system could be implemented efficiently without requiring downtime. Additionally, I would expand on how payment processing would be securely integrated and what backup measures would be in place to ensure uninterrupted service in case of failures.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the interview transcript and identifying the key pain points they wanted to address, such as improving customer access to training materials and reducing DMV test failure rates. I then translated these needs into specific system functionalities, such as an online learning platform, scheduling system, and secure payment processing. Considering user needs is crucial in software design because it ensures the system is functional, user-friendly, and meets business goals. A system that doesn’t align with user expectations can lead to poor adoption, inefficiency, and additional costs for redesigning features later.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software starts with gathering and analyzing user requirements, followed by breaking them down into functional and nonfunctional specifications. I use structured design techniques such as UML diagrams to visualize system components, interactions, and workflows. In the future, I would incorporate more iterative development strategies, such as Agile, to refine the design based on continuous feedback. Additionally, I would use prototyping to test user interactions early in the development process and ensure the system meets user expectations before full implementation.
